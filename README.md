# react-ts-shop-cart

Another React project. This time I checked how to cooperate with typescript in a new environment. The project use the [fake store api](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to get the fake data about products. The main feature is the shopping cart - so the user can add things to it & than change it quantity in the special panel.
